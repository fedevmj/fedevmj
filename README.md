### Hi! I'm a would-be frontend developer, Minjae 👋

Welcome to the place where my efforts and achievements have been recorded 🔖 <br>
Here you can check what I've learnt and created thus far 😘 <br><br>


✨ INTRODUCTION 


🔭 I’m currently working on cloning websites mainly using html, css, and javascript. <br>
🌱 Now I'm learning vue.js to build a mockup application. <br>
👩‍💻 I'm interested in learning a css preprocessor and a js library such as sass and grid to improve the productivity in publishing websites. <br>
🙆‍♀️ Besides, I'd love to study server-side tools like firebase to expand my knowledge of deploying applications.
